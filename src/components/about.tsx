                            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-12 mt-4 text-xl">At PLISMUN — Park Lane International School Model United Nations — we believe in the power of dialogue, critical thinking, and global awareness. Founded with the goal of empowering students to engage with the most pressing international issues of our time, PLISMUN is more than a conference; it&apos;s a platform for young voices to shape the future. <br /><br />Held annually in the heart of Prague, PLISMUN brings together delegates from around the world for three days of passionate debate, collaborative problem-solving, and cultural exchange. With diverse committees reflecting the structure of the United Nations, participants are challenged to think globally, speak diplomatically, and act responsibly. <br /><br />Whether you&apos;re a first-time delegate or an experienced MUN veteran, PLISMUN provides an inclusive, academically rigorous, and inspiring environment to develop leadership skills and lifelong friendships.</p>
