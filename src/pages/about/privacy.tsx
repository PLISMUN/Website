      <Heading size="lg">Keeping your data secure:</Heading>
      <Text>
        We use technological and organisational measures to ensure your data is
        safe and secure. Information provided to us is stored securely with
        passwords and encryption. Your account is controlled by a hashed
        password unique to you and cannot be accessed by anyone without
        knowledge of your email and password. Access to the database storing
        personal information is secure and restricted, shared with only those
        necessary in overseeing its administration. Be advised that the
        transmission of data over the Internet is not completely secure. While
        your connection to our website is protected by SSL encryption and we
        prioritise maintaining personal data integrity to the highest degree, we
        cannot guarentee the security of your data during transmission to our
        website, hence transmission of data is at your own risk. Our website may
        include links to third parties. Due to the fact that we have no control
        over the content and policies of these third parties, we therefore
        cannot accept responsibility for the protection and privacy of any
        information you provide whilst visiting these third party websites.
